# Dappeteer Test

This is a temporary repo for running automated tests with Puppeteer and Dappeteer

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. Make sure that you have the prequisites already installed

### Prerequisites

1. Install NodeJS (v 8.11.3)
2. Install Yarn (v 1.7.0)

## Installation

```
git clone git@github.com:josepmc/issuer-test.git [nameOfFolderOnLocalMachine]
$ yarn
$ npm test
```
### Setup

The code is already commented with step by step instructions. They are as follows:

1. Add your 12-word mnemonic for an account that already has Kovan ETH
2. Change network as necessary (Kovan is used at time of writing)
3. Change url as necessary (tokenstudio.polymath.network/ticker)
4. Change the Ticker Symbol for each test
